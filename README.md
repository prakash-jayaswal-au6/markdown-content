This repository houses is the raw markdown content for http://www.aerobatic.io. The
javascript on the site invokes the GitHub API via the Aerobatic service proxy
to retrieve the raw markdown. Within the proxy a filter is applied that
converts the markdown to HTML. This makes for a reasonable javascript powered
content management system.
